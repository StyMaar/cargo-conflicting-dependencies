This repository contains a simple reproduction for a Cargo “issue” (it's not a bug per se because exclusive features are frowned upon anyway, but that's still an): when different features are importing a different (and mutually incompatible) version of a crate, then cargo tires to find a matching version before realizing that the two incompatible versions aren't actually imported.
